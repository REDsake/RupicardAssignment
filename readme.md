Given problem statement

You have to make a database using google sheets. The following functionalities should be there: 

1. User enters name, mobile number through a webpage on front-end 
2. On submitting his details, data should get recorded in google sheets.

To keep in mind: 
1. We will not judge you on the look and feel of the front end, it just needs to be functional 
2. Do not use any external (3rd party) services that help in connecting with google sheets.

Once done, please submit: 
1. Hosted link of web page 
2. Link of google sheets where data is getting recorded 
3. Github repo
